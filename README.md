## SASS & Styled-components

This is my first try using **SASS** and **Styled-components**.

I've chosen Styled-components over Emotion after reading their documentation and the 2023 _State of CSS_ study. Emotion seems to start losing public's interest while Styled-components is still at the top.

1. SASS impressions

- The nested elements are very clear and pleasing to use
- Variables are efficient and clean
- Mixins are my whole life now âœ¨

2. Styled-Compnents impressions

- it's so hard to choose an element with this
- useful in very specific situations
