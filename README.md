# Our Flag Means Death - reviews

Using HBO Max's series **Our Flag Means Death** as inspiration for my **Wild Code School** homework.
This small project will evolve as I learn things over the months. First commit was after 5 weeks of lessons.

I've deployed this right here: [Our Flag Means Death S2 reviews](https://florencebuchelet.github.io/OFMDreviews/)

## SASS & Styled-components

This is my first try using **SASS** and **Styled-components**.

I've chosen Styled-components over Emotion after reading their documentation and the 2023 _State of CSS_ study. Emotion seems to start losing public's interest while Styled-components is still at the top.

1. SASS impressions

- the nested elements are very clear and pleasing to use
- I don't get yet the appeal of their variables over CSS3 vars
- I need to get used to @use and @mixin, I can see how useful they are but using them is still a bit challenging

2. Styled-Compnents impressions

- it's so hard to choose an element with this
- useful in very specific situations
